<h2>Project Statement</h2>
<br>
 <p>For this project I tried to use inspiration from old cartoons and animations from a character called Peacock from Skull girlts. I thought making the circle move was cute, since the Peacock has something similar. I made it my own by adding different animations and making it slightly funny and cute as the little ball character moves and bounces off and it continues as a loop, i really like how it came out. Since it was frame by frame I ended up with a lot of frames, roughly 400-500. I did use tweening so it'd be easier for me to animate, and I did learn to animate in photoshop a bit which was definitely really fun. For my storyboard my idea was just have her chase another toon, but it proved to be too big a challenge, same as adding the audio, i had a hard time finding sounds that reminded me of the toons. But i think that's the closest i got, i didn want to incorporate the jingle that the airlines use when they need to make an announcement . But that sound was the closest I got to what I wanted. </p>
